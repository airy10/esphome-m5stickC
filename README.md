**NOTE**:
A st7735 screen component is now part of esphome and a more complete axp192 component can be found here :

  https://gitlab.com/geiseri/esphome_extras/-/tree/main/components/axp192

------------
Additional components to use esphome with a M5StickC.  
Mostly a work in progress.  
Copy the components to a `custom_components` directory next to your .yaml configuration file.

- axp192 : power management - configuration hard coded for the M5StickC - should be made more generic.
  Must be present to initialize the screen power.  
  Can be also used to read some of the power info - most sensors aren't published yet.  
  Mostly the AXP192 from M5Stack sample code adapted for esphome.
- st7735 : TFT screen  - configuration hard coded for the M5StickC - should be made more generic.  
  Adapted from https://github.com/musk95/esphome-1/tree/dev/esphome/components/st7789v + M5StickC sample code for the init
